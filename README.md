# Machine Learning algorithms and Data Science Implementations using Python , Maltab and Octave 
Python programming basics , practices and extensively data science application and usage

# K-means clustering and Principal Component analysis: 
K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data
examples together.Concretely, you are given a training set {x (1), ..., x(m)} and want to group the data into a few cohesive “clusters”.
You will use principal component analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction. 

# Linear Regression: 
You implement Linear Regression by computing the cost fucntion and minimizing the cost and finding the gradient descent for supporting 
theta values. You also implement linear regression for multi variables adding feature normalization to it.

#Logistic Regression: 
You implement Logistic regression to predict the result as true or false. Here you also implement sigmoid function , logistic regression
cost function, regularize the cost function and gradients.

#Multi-class classification and neural network: 
You will use logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9).Automated handwritten digit
recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. At first
you will use logistic regression and apply it to one-vs-all classification. Then you implement multi-class logistic regression to recognize handwritten digits.

#Normal Distribution and recommendation engine: 
You will implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.
On that dataset you will fit a Gaussian distribution and then find values that have very low probability and hence can be considered anomalies.
You will apply the anomaly detection algorithm to a larger dataset with many dimensions. You will use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.

#Regularised Linear Regression and Bias vs variance: 
You will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.
You will implement regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.
You will go through some diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine the effects of bias v.s. variance.

#Spam Classifier using Support Vector machine: 
You will be using support vector machines (SVMs) with various example 2D datasets. Experimenting with these datasets
will help you gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs. You will be using support vector machines to build a spam classifier.
The dataset included for this exercise is based on a a subset of the SpamAssassin Public Corpus.
